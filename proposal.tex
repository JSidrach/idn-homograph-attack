\section{What}

- Explain the attack
  - When/how were IDN introduced
  - Homograph letters
  - How to use this to the attackers advantage

Domain name were designed to support ASCII character. Internationalized domain name(IDN) was proposed in December 1996 by Martin DÃ¼rst for the purpose of letting non-English speaking people use Internet without restriction[1]. The solution is to implement unicode mapping every character in different language to a unique number. Homograph letters, however, could be a potential vulnerability. For example, Cyrillic letter 'a' can look identical to Latin letter 'a'. Attackers can use the website "www.apple.com" where 'a' actually is a Cyrillic letter to attack users. In some other language, like Chinese, there exists many homographs between traditional Chinese and simplified Chinese.

- Research
  - On websites
    - Top 500 Alexa Websites
    - Try all possible variations
    - Classify: 404, redirect (legitimate), malicious, unrelated
    - Evaluation
  - On browsers
    - % Affected, version affected
    - Screenshots before/after CVE (url bar, hover link)
    - Other possible policies: why they may work or they won't
      - Maybe domain providers should not allow IDNs close to real names?
      - Whitelist/blacklist

- Conclusion
  - Impact of the vulnerability based on empirical data and % of users still vulnerable
  - Possible solution for this vulnerability. How does company solve this problem.

\section{Why}
- Relatively new CVE discovered because this (https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=683314)
- How something beneficial for the users IDN could be turned against them
- Hard for regular users to distinguish between real/fake sites
- Easy to collect data to evaluate impact

\section{Potential Issues}
- The potential impact, it may be actually really low
- If we will find not legitimate sites by substitution (sample size may be low)
- If there are a lot of illegitime sites, we would need to check manually if they are just a redirect or a scam, maybe we will need to find an automatic way



\section{Resources}
Resources
- We believe for the TOP500 sites + variations of each one we can check it with our own computers/crawlers, same for different browsers
