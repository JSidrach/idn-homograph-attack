### Possible Projects

* Usability/Analysis of password managers
  * Cons: Is this worthy of a paper?
  * Comments: looks good - Chen
* Usability of Tor Browser
  * Cons: Too broad? Not novel?
  * Comments: looks good - Chen
* Analysis of Insecure Defaults: IoT devices
  * Cons: Too broad?
  * Comments: hard to evaluate - Chen
* Private data exposed in public github repositories
  * Cons: Done already? May require too much computation power?
  * Comments: looks good - Chen
* Detect when users use similar passwords and warn them (without storing passwords)
  * Cons: Is this technically feasible? Does this make the user more secure?
  * Comments: Too lazy to use different password. Maybe something like password generator based on the same info - Chen
* Security Analysis of Common Wireless Networking Implementations
  * Cons: Too technical for us? Do we have the knowledge to evaluate this?
  * Comments: Hard to evaluate ( I don't know anything about network ) - Chen
* Security Analysis of Chat Apps
  * Cons: Done already? Not worthy of a paper??
  * Comments: looks good - Chen
* Analysis of https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=683314 (URL Unicode Issue)
  * Cons: Not worthy of a paper??
  * Comments: looks good - Chen
* Analysis of Android Malware Detection
  * Cons: Too easy
  * subtopics: Analysis of common Android Malware/ How Android Malware affects phone/How to detect it traditionaly/ How to detect it in Machine Learning/ Maybe implement a dectection framework /
  * Evaluate: Maybe analyze how many percantage for different kinds of Malware / how to hide from the detection, feasible solution / analyze the accuracy if we implement a detection method
  * related paper ( These papers are just a possible way to analyze different kinds of Malware in different ways): Energy Attacks on Mobile Devices https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.04464.pdf, Semi-supervised Classification for Dynamic

  * Comments: proposer - Chen
* Analysis of database intrusion detection
  * Cons: Done already? Maybe focus on specific database intrusion detection system?
  * Related research: [Approaches and Challenges in Database Intrusion Detection](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/2eb4/e0dccae7de1b348f0795fb7d15c185a344ba.pdf)?
  * Comments: looks good - Chen
* Analysis of vulnerabilities in typical NoSQL database (MongoDB, CouchBase, etc)
  * Cons: Could be too broad.?
  * Comments: looks good - Chen
